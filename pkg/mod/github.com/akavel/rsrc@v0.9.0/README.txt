rsrc - Tool for embedding binary resources in Go programs.

INSTALL: go get github.com/akavel/rsrc

USAGE:

rsrc.exe [-manifest FILE.exe.manifest] [-ico FILE.ico[,FILE2.ico...]] -o FILE.syso
  Generates a .syso file with specified resources embedded in .rsrc section,
  aimed for consumption by Go linker when building Win32 excecutables.

The generated *.syso files should get automatically recognized by 'go build'
command and linked into an executable/library, as long as there are any *.go
files in the same directory.

OPTIONS:
  -arch string
    	architecture of output file - one of: 386, amd64, [EXPERIMENTAL: arm, arm64] (default "386")
  -data string
    	path to raw data file to embed [WARNING: useless for Go 1.4+]
  -ico string
    	comma-separated list of paths to .ico files to embed
  -manifest string
    	path to a Windows manifest file to embed
  -o string
    	name of output COFF (.res or .syso) file (default "rsrc.syso")

Based on ideas presented by Minux.
